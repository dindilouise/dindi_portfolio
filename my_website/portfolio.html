      <p style="font-size:135%;">  For this project, we were given the task of creating a story or game; my partner, Karina Gutierrez, and I decided to create a story based game. The storyline of this game is about two birds PoPo and JuJu, who are part of an organization that helps animals in need, they go about looking for animals in destress and the goal of the game is to help decide what the birds are going to do. The process of creating this game was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier. The game’s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger decisions markers to disappear or appear, as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several if-then statements, which was a main portion in making the game functioning. A major problem we had was that we had a glitch during the introduction of the storyline, the player was able to change characters mid way the intro part. We fixed this by making a list and adding the bird characters to it, to make sure that this problem wouldn’t stay within the game. I am very please with the outcome of the game, it is very aesthetic and interactive.</p>
