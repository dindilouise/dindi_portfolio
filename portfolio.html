         <p style="float:left" > For this project we created a story based game that included algorithms and abstractions to make the program
                    as simple as possible to make this a functioning game. We created the characters Juju and Popo, the resuce birds
                    that help animals who are injured or is in need of assistance. We designed it to be an interactive game play, so
                    the player uses the mouse to click on items or on check marks and 'X' s to determine whether they wanted to help 
                    or whether which item they wanted to use to help the animal out. We used msny broadcasts within the program. So 
                    when an item was clicked on then the other items will disappear and the characters begin to talk. </p>
