      <center><p style="font-size:135%;">  For this project, we were given the task of creating a story or game; my partner, Karina Gutierrez,
                                      and I decided <br> to create a story based game. The storyline of this game is about two birds PoPo and JuJu, 
                                      who are part of an organization <br> that helps animals in need, they go about looking for animals in distress 
                                      and the goal of the game is to help decide what the <br> birds are going to do. The process of creating this game 
                                      was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole <br>game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier. 
                                      The game’s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger<br> decisions markers to disappear or appear,
                                      as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several if-then <br>statements, which 
                                      was a main portion in making the game functioning. A major problem we had was that there was a glitch during <br>the 
                                      introduction of the storyline, the player was able to change characters mid way the intro part. We fixed this
                                      by making a list<br> and adding the bird characters to it, to make sure that this problem wouldn’t stay within the game.
                                      I am very please with the outcome<br> of the game, it is very aesthetic and interactive. To see for yourself, click the picture to play the game.</p></center>

 <p style="font-size:135%;" >  <img src="images/engstom_og.png"  align="middle"> This is the original picture me and my partner decided to alter for this project.
                                                                            <br> The objective of this project was to alter a picture of our choosing in some type of way, so my partner and I picked <br>
                                                                                    this picture and decided to alter the RGB colors. It was difficult at first to figure out how to get the images to <br>
                                                                                    show up,  but then after trial and error, my partner and I figured out that if we call the image to show it will pop up.<br>
                                                                                    Also, we learned that changing the R B G in the section changes the colors into a certain color that isn't called upon. <br>
                                                                                    We ended up creating 4 different styles of pictures, which are all not the same. It has different background colors,<br>
                                                                                    different face colors; all creating different types of images. If we were to continue with this project and manipulating<br> 
                                                                                    the image's RBG code we could make art similar to the style of art pop. Understanding the process of this manipulation <br>
                                                                                    allows me to understand the concept of other color image manipulation.

                                          This presentation is about the malware Sammy worm. The Sammy worm is this virus that was created by Sammy Kumar,who <br>
                                           though it would be funny to get more followers, but it ended in a disaster. It made MySpace shut down for 2 hours 
                                    and his profile was deleted after hitting <br> over a million followers. This occured in only the span of around 2 days. The federal
                                    government also got involved since it was the first type of hacking with <br> such a huge impact to occur. Sammy used cross-site scripting (XXS)
                                    which injects a malicious script into a vulnerable website, which latched onto the other accounts. <br> I learned that users must be very cautious
                                    on the accounts or messages we  click and open because we never knock if there is another Sammy worm out there. <br> That malicous code could be latched 
                                    onto anything and everyone. It can come in many forms that can seem harmless, but the effects of viruses can be extraordinary, to the point <br>
                                    the federal government becomes involved. The only way a person can be safe from a virus is by not using any electronics, because not even the <br>
                                    most sophisticated malware, or antivirus can defend against the harshest virus.

                                        cameras that track and measure the child’s <br> motions and facial expressions and interactions with the robot. This is considered big data because it <br> uses volcanism, requiring 
                                        a lot of time, energy, and human resources.

                                        answered through data: pie charts, bar graphs, histogram. The question we came up with was "What is the number of full-time <br>
                                        workers in the 1st quarter of 2018 by race". We ended up creating several pie charts; since we split up the data by race and the <br>
                                        sections into range of age. There is also a bar graph showing the total amount of workers ranging from the ages 16 and older. In doing this <br>
                                        project, I created the visual representations of the data as well as contributing to a bit of the response,  but my partner Jose did most of the <br>
                                        response. I now understand how to create pie charts and graphs to better interpret data collected, I can incorporate this skill when making presentations <br>
                                        to show people the results and data that I would have collected for a certain project, or observations I took part in.</p>

                                  For this project, my partner and I were supposed to modify a code from Netlogo. We found this simulation of rotating 3-D shapes<br>
                                  We discovered the coding that would alter the form of the shape: making it look stretched out along the x-axis, and the form was more flat and oblong.<br>
                                  When we put it under the simulation, the affects were different from the previous. As the shap spun around the silhouette was a different shape than the <br>
                                  the original. This simulation was written in a language neither me or my partner knew, but we understood the gist of the language, and we ended up finding <br>
                                  the section of code that determined the form of the shape. </p>
