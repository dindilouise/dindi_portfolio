      <center><p style="font-size:135%;">  For this project, we were given the task of creating a story or game; my partner, Karina Gutierrez,
                                      and I decided <br> to create a story based game. The storyline of this game is about two birds PoPo and JuJu, 
                                      who are part of an organization <br> that helps animals in need, they go about looking for animals in distress 
                                      and the goal of the game is to help decide what the <br> birds are going to do. The process of creating this game 
                                      was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole <br>game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier. 
                                      The game’s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger<br> decisions markers to disappear or appear,
                                      as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several if-then <br>statements, which 
                                      was a main portion in making the game functioning. A major problem we had was that there was a glitch during <br>the 
                                      introduction of the storyline, the player was able to change characters mid way the intro part. We fixed this
                                      by making a list<br> and adding the bird characters to it, to make sure that this problem wouldn’t stay within the game.
                                      I am very please with the outcome<br> of the game, it is very aesthetic and interactive. To see for yourself, click the picture to play the game.</p></center>
